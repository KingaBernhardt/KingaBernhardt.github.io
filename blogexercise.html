	<h2>Children's Development through Outdoor Learning</h2>
<p class="first">Outdoor learning can have a positive impact on children's development but it needs to be formally adopted, a report suggests.
Childhoods were dramatically changing, with fewer opportunities to spend time outdoors, researchers observed.
The loss of exposure to the natural environment would have negative long-term consequences, they warned.
Establishing an "outdoor learning hub" would help teachers, and help shape policies and strategy, they suggested.</p>

<p>The report highlighted previous studies that showed that busier family lives, combined with an increased sense of fear in society, children were having fewer opportunities to explore their surrounding natural environment.
This was hampering children's social skills as well as risking stifling their long-term physical, emotional development and wellbeing. Therefore, it was important that schools did not overlook the opportunities that outdoor learning provided to bridge this gap.
"At the moment, if outdoor learning is part of a school's curriculum in England, it is largely because the teachers recognise the value of it," said report co-author, Sue Waite, a reader in outdoor learning at Plymouth University, UK.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Play in Children's Development</h2>
<div class"post">
<p class="first">Play can be defined as “any spontaneous or organized activity that provides enjoyment, entertainment, amusement or diversion.”3 When children play, they engage with their environment in a safe context in which ideas and behaviors can be combined and practiced. Children enhance their problem solving and flexible thinking, learn how to process and display emotions, manage fears and interact with others.4 Free, unstructured play allows children to practice making decisions without prompted instructions or the aim of achieving an end goal. They can initiate their own freely chosen activities and experiment with open-ended rules.</p>

<p>Children’s play behaviors may vary based on cultural norms and family preferences. While some cultures emphasize individualism and independent play, others engage in more parent-directed play and activities. This can influence how children play with toys and interact with their peers and family members. 7 To help provide advice to families with different values, styles of play, and communication, health professionals can offer these recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics:</p>

<p><ul>
	<li>Allow for 1 hour a day of unstructured, free play</li>
	<li>Limit child’s media time to less than 1 to 2 hours a day</li>
	<li>No media usage for children under 2</li>
	<li>Establish “Screen free zones” by keeping TVs, computers and video games out of children’s bedrooms</li>
	<li>Limit “background media” use during playtime and family activities because it is distracting for children and adults</li>
</ul>
